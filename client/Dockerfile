# Stage 1: Build React App
FROM node:22-alpine AS builder

WORKDIR /app

# 🧠 Only copy dependency descriptors first to leverage Docker cache
COPY package.json package-lock.json ./

# ⚡ Clean and fast install using lock file (CI-style)
RUN npm ci

# 📦 Now copy the rest of your app source
COPY . .

# 🏗️ Build the React app (generates static files in /build)
RUN npm run build

# Stage 2: Serve with Nginx
FROM nginx:alpine

# 🚚 Copy built static files from builder stage
COPY --from=builder /app/build /usr/share/nginx/html

# 🧾 Add custom nginx config (optional but usually required for SPA)
COPY nginx/default.conf /etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf

# 🌐 Expose port 80 for HTTP
EXPOSE 80

# 🚀 Start nginx
CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]
# Note: Nginx will automatically serve files from /usr/share/nginx/html
# and handle routing for a React SPA.
